hi hi, I'm currently making a Login Page, Registration Page, and a Profile page to demonstrate my UI/UX skills. I'm still learning hehe but I'll demonstrate what you need to do.

### Login (Sign in) Page
- There is currently 1 dummy data you can use to login and go to the profile page.
- Username: `admin` Password: `password`
- This is just to test porting you to the next page.

### Sign up (Registration) page
- You can register yourself as a user, BUT its just a simulation, it doesnt really save (store) your data.
- Please use Username: `admin` Password: `password` to login hehe.

### Profile page (WIP)
- Does really have much to offer yet.
